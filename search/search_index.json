Before embarking on his entrepreneurial journey, he was a senior research engineer and engineering team leader in Bloomberg 's AI Engineering group, which then consists of 200+ researchers and engineers responsible for building financial solutions using technologies from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Dialog Understanding, Graph Analytics, Time Series Analysis, Information Retrieval, Recommendation Systems, Speech Recognition, Computer Vision, and Optimization. Qian earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the GroupLens lab at the University of Minnesota, where he was advised by Professor Joe Konstan . Qian's research interests lie broadly at the intersection of machine learning and human-computer interaction (e.g., user-centered design and evaluation of online interactive recommender systems). Before that, he worked in industry in China for a few years, where he focused on large-scale data mining and machine learning systems for video recommendation and computational advertising products.
