I'm currently leading a team in the Artificial Intelligence Group at [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/), focused on interactive machine learning and human-AI collaboration. I graduated with a Ph.D. from [GroupLens lab](https://grouplens.org), Computer Science, at the University of Minnesota in May 2018, advised by [Prof. Joe Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu). My research interests are **recommender systems**, **social computing**, **human-computer interaction** and **interactive machine learning**.
