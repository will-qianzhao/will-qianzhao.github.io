###  Qian Zhao (or Will)

I'm currently a Senior Research Engineer in Artificial Intelligence Group, [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/). I graduated with a Ph.D. from [GroupLens lab](https://grouplens.org), Computer Science, at the University of Minnesota in May 2018, advised by [Prof. Joe Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu). My research interest lies at the intersection of **recommender systems**, **human-computer interaction** and **machine learning**. My research goal is to bring human factors of attention, perception, decision-making, goal-directed and contextualized information needs into the statistical or computational models of information recommendation systems. My research employs mixed-method approaches, by understanding prominent user factors from theory, lab experiments and field studies; developing algorithms that take account of those factors; and evaluating their effects on user experience through field experiments.
