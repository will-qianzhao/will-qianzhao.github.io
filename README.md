## Introduction

### Research Interest

- My research interest lies at the intersection of recommender systems, human-computer interaction and machine learning. My research goal is to bring human factors of attention, perception, decision-making, goal-directed and contextualized information needs into the statistical or computational models of information recommendation systems. My research employs mixed-method approaches, by understanding prominent user factors from theory, lab experiments and field studies; developing algorithms that take account of those factors; and evaluating their effects on user experience through field experiments.
